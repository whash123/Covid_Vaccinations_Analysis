# Covid Vaccinations Analysis

This is a Python project analyzing and visualizing the current progress for the Covid vaccination rollout across the world. You can find the link to the dataset here, which is updated each day to include more vaccination data:

Note I performed this analysis on vaccination data up until 3/13/21 so things obviously could have changed since then!

Above in the files you can find a Jupyter notebook file and a normal Python .py scipt where you can play around with the analys and visualizations. You will see many of them are built as functions that you can pass different arguments for and have a look at altered charts from the ones I have produced in this file. Have a look!
